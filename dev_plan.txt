Development Plan

Pipeline Overview

1. Perform HOG on lower half of frame
	a. Extract features as [ x ]

2. Perform color historgram on lower half of frame

3. Perform sliding window search (scaled by view distance) across lower half of frame.
	a. For overlapping detections, use centroid of overlapped area

4. Utilize heat map across several frames to filter object detection

5. Draw bounding box on detected vehicles



Training Procedure

1. Extract HOG and color histogram to create feature vector [ x ] + [ x ]

2. Feed feature vector to linear SVM.
